## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap creation: 8-phase structure derived from 27 v1 requirements
- Phase 2: German validation checkpoint flagged as critical (Week 1 testing in Runway/Pika)
- Coverage: All 27 v1 requirements mapped to phases
- Phase 1: Database schema complete with video_prompts table, RLS, CASCADE

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- **Phase 2 - German Language Risk**: Video AI models (Runway/Pika/Kling) primarily trained on English. German prompt effectiveness unvalidated. Requires empirical testing in Phase 2 Week 1. Fallback strategy prepared if German prompts underperform (English prompts with German UI labels).
