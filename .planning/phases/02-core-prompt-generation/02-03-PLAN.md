<objective>
Validate that German video prompts work effectively in external AI video tools.

Purpose: This is the CRITICAL German language validation checkpoint flagged in the roadmap. Video AI models (Runway, Pika, Kling) are primarily trained on English. Before building UI around German prompts, we must empirically test that German prompts produce acceptable video results.

Output: User confirmation that German prompts work, or decision to implement English fallback strategy.

  <what-built>
German video prompt generation system using Gemini:
- Server action that analyzes images and generates German video prompts
- Prompts include camera styles (Cinematic, Slow Motion, etc.) and film effects
- Output optimized for AI video tools (50-150 words)
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
**Test the German prompts in external AI video tools:**

1. **Generate test prompts:**
   - Use the server action to generate 5-10 German video prompts from different images
   - Vary the camera styles and film effects
   - Include some with user instructions, some without

2. **Test in Runway Gen-3 Alpha:**
   - Go to https://app.runwayml.com
   - Use "Image to Video" mode
   - Upload a test image
   - Paste the German video prompt
   - Generate a video (5-10 seconds)
   - Observe: Does the video follow the prompt? Does German work?

3. **Test in Pika (alternative):**
   - Go to https://pika.art
   - Upload a test image
   - Paste the German video prompt
   - Generate a video
   - Compare results to Runway

4. **Evaluate quality:**
   - Do camera movements match the described style?
   - Are film effects (lighting, mood) applied?
   - Does the person/subject move as described?
   - Is quality comparable to English prompts?

**Document findings:**
- Which tool(s) tested
- Number of prompts tested
- Success rate (prompts that produced acceptable videos)
- Any patterns (certain styles work better, certain phrases fail)
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>
Type one of:
- "approved" - German prompts work well enough to proceed
- "fallback needed" - German prompts underperform, describe issues
- "partial" - Some work, some don't, provide details for refinement
  </resume-signal>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
User has tested German prompts in at least one external AI video tool and confirmed:
1. German language is understood by the video AI
2. Camera styles and film effects are applied
3. Video quality is acceptable for the use case

OR user has identified that fallback to English is needed with specific reasoning.
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- User explicitly confirms German prompts work ("approved")
- OR user provides feedback for implementing English fallback strategy
- Decision is documented for future reference
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/02-core-prompt-generation/02-03-SUMMARY.md`

Include in summary:
- Tools tested
- Number of prompts tested
- Verdict (German OK / Fallback needed)
- Any refinements needed for prompt generation
</output>
